# GAME & WATCH Raspberry Pi Pico

This MicroPython project transforms your Raspberry Pi Pico (W) into a multifunctional IoT device — combining a real-time clock, live temperature/pressure sensor, weather updates from OpenWeatherMap, and a classic Snake game.
It displays information on an OLED screen and provides a web-based control interface for remote interaction.

- Clock Mode – Displays the current date and time.
- Temperature Mode – Reads live data from a BMP280 sensor.
- Weather Mode – Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Snake Game – Play the classic Snake directly on your OLED display.
- Web Interface – Control modes and the Snake game remotely from any browser on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Mode Button (GP15) – Physical button cycles through all available modes.
